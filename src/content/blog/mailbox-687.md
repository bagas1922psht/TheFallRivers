## Setup

- enter `2` for English
- enter PIN - `#` - `#`
- `2` for default greeting - `#`

## Settings

- enable pin `3` - `4` - `2`
- change pin `3` - `4` - `1` - `PIN` - `#`

once everything is done, you can receive a voicemail by entering your PIN and then #. for example you want to receive a voice message from WhatsApp to receive a verification code, choose how to verify by call, later the voice message will arrive in the mailbox, wait a few minutes (estimate the time the call for verification is complete so that it becomes a voice message that will arrive in the mailbox)

> Use the same caller number as the target, you can use the modified international phone app to change the caller number, call +687 23.45.67 or call the same number
